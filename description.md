# Introduction

Open research practices are gaining traction across the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. In our experience, these practices are taken up by a cadre of "open research enthusiasts." We saw, for instance, these enthusiasts come together at the Boston Working Open Workshop.

Our challenge as advocates of open research is to reach beyond these enthusiasts to the rest of our research communities, to those people who haven't yet embraced open research practices.

# Goals

1. Coalesce the community of open research enthusiasts in the greater Boston area
2. Send these enthusiasts into their own research communities to encourage open research practices
3. Bring newcomers into the Boston open research community

# Proposed activities

We propose to hold a series of workshops throughout the summer of 2018 (Fig. 1).

The first event will be focused on building the BORG and on identifying challenges to the dissemination of open research. We will invite open research enthusiasts from around the area for a day-long workshop. We will introduce our vision for the BORG, provide a few activities focused on how to spread open research practices within our communities, and participate in a brainstorming session to identify goals and challenges that we face.

After the first event, we will send our open research enthusiasts, the BORG members, back to their disciplinary communities to host a workshop to help spread open research practices.

The second Boston-wide event will be a check-in with the BORG members. We would like to hear how the first few satellite workshops have gone. This event will be open to attendees of the satellite events if they would like to come engage more with the BORG community.

After the second event, more satellite workshops will be held. These will be otherwise identical to the first round of satellite workshops, but they should be able to incorporate any ideas that were discussed at the second big event.

The third event will be an Open Research Extravaganza at which attendees of the satellite events will be able to present on their experiences getting involved in open research. The focus is on stories about open practices rather than on finished products. 

## Budget

Out of a $5,000 minigrant, we propose to spend $2000 on the big BORG events, and $3000 on the satellite workshops. These funds will go towards food for the workshops and any room rental or audiovisual needs as well as smaller costs to help the BORG administer all of these events (such as Meetup.com fees). The satellite workshops will ideally take place within institutions that can provide space. 

# Moving forwards

These summer events will develop a community of open researchers at various stages in their engagement, from seasoned open research enthusiasts to those who have gotten involved during the satellite workshops. We want to keep this community going with

- Boston-wide BORG events, satellite events at area institutions led by BORG members, and cosponsorship of events led by other area open research organizations
- An online discussion forum
- A Boston-area open research mentorship program modeled on the Open Leadership Cohort
