# One sentence description

The grant will support the Boston Open Researcher Group to host a series of workshops that will leverage the disciplinary networks of open research enthusiasts to bring their colleagues into the open research community.

# Objectives

1. **Connect the community of open research advocates in the greater Boston area** (the number of BORG members listed on our website after the first BORG workshop).
2. **Send these advocates into their own research communities to encourage open research practices** (the reports from the advocates at the second BORG workshop).
3. **Bring newcomers into the Boston open research community** (the growth in BORG membership over the summer).

# Audience

- **Enthusiasts**: Active members of the open research community.
- **Newcomers**: Researchers who are new to open research practices.

# Proposed activities

We propose to hold a series of workshops throughout the summer of 2018. There will be two different kinds of workshops. "BORG workshops" will be larger, centralized events that will gather open researchers together to identify and solve challenges that prevent the spread of open research practices. "Satellite workshops" will be smaller events focused within a single discipline that implement those solutions. We plan to have three BORG workshops and around eight satellite workshops.

## Budget

The proposed budget is $5000. We plan to spend $1000 on each of three BORG workshops ($3000) and $250 for each of eight satellite workshops ($2000).

# Outputs

- **Curriculum**: The first two BORG workshops will result in a curriculum and a collection of resources for spreading open research practices.
- **Directory**: We will list BORG members on our website as a resource for those looking to contact open research enthusiasts.
- **Meetup**: We will start a Meetup.com page that will advertise BORG events to a wider audience.

# Outcomes

These summer events will develop a community of open researchers at various stages in their engagement, from seasoned open research advocates to those making their first forays into open research in the satellite workshops. We would like the BORG to continue to support the local open community with Boston-wide events, satellite workshops and an area open research mentorship program. The momentum from the summer's activities will help us to make an argument to develop the partnerships with local institutions such as libraries, universities and companies that will make this a sustainable community.
